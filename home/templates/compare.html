              <td>Excellent for understanding the context of words in sentences, handles complex language tasks well, pre-trained on large datasets which can be fine-tuned for specific tasks.</td>

              </td>
              <td>Captures long-term dependencies, handles sequences effectively, good for tasks like text classification and sentiment analysis.
              </td>

              </td>
              <td>Simple to implement, interpretable results, works well when the relationship between features and the outcome is approximately linear.

              </td>
              <td>Effective in high-dimensional spaces, robust to overfitting, good for cases where the number of dimensions exceeds the number of samples.
              </td>
              <td>Less effective with large datasets, may not perform well with very complex data relationships, requires careful tuning of parameters.
